# Polynomial-Operation-Calculator-
In this project, a Polynomial Operations Calculator is designed and implemented using the  Linked List data structure. Each term of the polynomial is represented as a node in a linked  list, storing the coefficient and exponent. This approach ensures efficient handling of sparse  polynomials and dynamic memory usage.
